## Efficient Audit Sample Selection

Currently, I am writing my thesis about efficient audit sample selection. The goal is to develop a procedure that selects audit samples that are representative, but also efficient in terms of the effort that is needed to evaluate such a sample. Eventually, we aim to summarize the results of the study in a practical guideline for researchers.

If you would like a more detailed overview of the project, feel free to read my [research report](docs/researchrep.pdf), that provides an introduction to the method and an overview of the current state of the project.
