The goal is to develop a procedure that selects audit samples that are representative, but also efficient in terms of the effort that is needed to evaluate such a sample. Eventually, we aim to summarize the results of the study in a practical guideline for researchers.\nIf you would like a more detailed overview of the project, feel free to read my research report, that provides an introduction to the method and an overview of the current state of the project."
