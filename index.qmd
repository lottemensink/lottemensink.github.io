## Hi there!

I'm Lotte. I am a Methodology and Statistics student at Utrecht University. I am currently writing my thesis, and soon I will be graduated. Besides studying, I teach statistics to Bachelor students, which is something I really like to do. Within the field of statistics, my interests are broad. These are some topics that I find particularly interesting:

Structural Equation Modelling

Causal Inference

Administrative Data in Official Statistics
